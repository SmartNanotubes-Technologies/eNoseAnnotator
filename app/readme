// TODO
// important
- test: extra thread for serial communication necessary?
- stop measurement based on gradient, ui symbols for status

- store absolute values in measurement
    -> relative values are emitted only to relLGraph
- debug selection
- add absolute mode to lineGraph
    -> Delete x-label, Edit y-label
    -> add absolute values in kOhm
- clean up saving/ loading
    -> introduce a well defined save/load module ?
- set label size based on y-range
- set label color
- save data before exiting
- free zoom

// optional
- move multiMode to vector
- linegraph: only hide graphs with sensor failures -> no redraw necessary
- sync relative and absolute graphs
