// TODO
// important

// optional
- free zoom
- stop measurement based on gradient, ui symbols for status
- action to continue measurements

// features
- line graphs:
    - line graphs for functionalisation averages
    -> default: use functionalisation averages, option to see all channel values
    - channel colors based on functionalisation colors

- TorchScript support

- reimplement color schemes:
    - better color palette
    - channel colors based on functionalisation
    - clear difference between classification & measurement colors
- create new measurement without starting it

// bugs
- connecting sensor after some time -> neative resistance values
- zero-vectors in save file?
- continuous marking -> only part is selected
- update functionalisation bar graph after changing funtionalisation
- reset filename after starting new measurement
- widgets move when saving
