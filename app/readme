// TODO
// important

- test: extra thread for serial communication necessary?
- stop measurement based on gradient, ui symbols for status

- add absolute mode to lineGraph
    -> Delete x-label, Edit y-label
    -> add absolute values in kOhm
- clean up saving/ loading
    -> introduce a well defined save/load module ?

// optional
- move multiMode to vector
- sync relative and absolute graphs
- free zoom
- pick LineGraphWidget colors based on BarGraphWidget::Mode

// measurements
- zero-vectors in save file?
- continuous marking -> only part is selected
- resetting connection: measurement is started
