- action to continue measurements


// features
- line graphs:
    - line graphs for functionalisation averages
    -> default: use functionalisation averages, option to see all channel values
    - channel colors based on functionalisation colors
    - tool: select graph of single channel/ functionalisation
    -> see number + graph in forefront
    - tool: show current x/y position of mouse when hovering over line graphs
- TorchScript support
- support two annotation types: multiple aclasses with and without values:
    - classes:
        - add annotation class
    - line graph:
        - draw multi-colored rectangles based on annotations
        - tooltips with class names + values

// bugs
- connecting sensor after some time -> neative resistance values
- zero-vectors in save file?
- continuous marking -> only part is selected
