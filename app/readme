// TODO
// important
- test: extra thread for serial communication necessary?
- stop measurement based on gradient, ui symbols for status

- merge annotation and measurement:
    -> draw class abreviation on top of graph
    -> set user defined class of selection
    -> load/ store  classification
- store absolute values in measurement
-> relative values are emitted only to relLGraph
-debug selection

// optional
- move multiMode to vector
- adjust sizes of tableWidget & tableview automaticallly
- linegraph: only hide graphs with sensor failures -> no redraw necessary
